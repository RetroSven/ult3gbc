This uses a very old version of the Gameboy Development Kit (GBDK) which has some paths hard-coded into the compiler/linker executables.  Therefore, compiling is a little odd.

WINDOWS:

Copy the "sdk" branch to the root of a main drive (e.g. C:\sdk, D:\sdk, etc)
cd /d c:\sdk\gbz80-gb\2-1-5\lib
make
cd /d c:\sdk\gbz80-gb\2-1-5\examples\u3
make

LINUX:

Copy/symlink the "sdk" branch to root directory, then:
cd /sdk/gbz80-gb/2-1-5/lib
wine cmd /c make.bat
cd /sdk/gbz80-gb/2-1-5/examples/u3
wine cmd /c make.bat
